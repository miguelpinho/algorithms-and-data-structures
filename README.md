# Algorithms and Data Structures Project

This repository contains the final project for the Algorithms and Data
Structures Course of the 1st Semester of 2015/2016.

It was developed by Miguel Malaca (@malaca3) and Miguel Pinho (@miguelpinho),
and it passed all the 20 evaluation tests in the course's Mooshak (in the memory
and time constraints). The project had the final grade of 19 (in 20).

This project consisted in an optimal route planner for an underground car park.
It touched on several concepts lectured in the course, and in particular it
solved the problem efficiently (in terms of memory and run time) using a
modified version of **Dijkstra's algorithm**. It also provides efficient
implementations of the necessary data structures, including **linked lists**,
**heaps**, and **hash tables**.
